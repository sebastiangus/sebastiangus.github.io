#What is Open Graph?
Open Graph is a protocol to let web page creators make their content more presentable for social platforms. You ad meta-tags to your pages to let platforms scan your site and present accoirding to the protocol.


##How I use OG
I use OG to extract data about Title, Description (excerpt - first paragraph, stripped from HTML code), page.url, section, tags and author.

    meta property="og:title"
    meta property="og:description"
    meta property="og:article:url"
    meta property="og:article:section"
    meta property="og:article:tag"
    meta property="og:article:author"
