#Robots.txt
The Robots Exclusion Standard uses a file placed in the site-root named robots.txt to let robots know if their allowed or not on the site.
Of course it's not a protection against "evil" robots but for the good ones it's possible to checkout if their wanted on the site or not. You may also "deny" access to a certain folder,
but be aware of that evil bots will probably scan for just those excluded places.

##No robots.txt
If you have no robots.txt the robots will interpret that as you'd like to have all of your site scanned.
