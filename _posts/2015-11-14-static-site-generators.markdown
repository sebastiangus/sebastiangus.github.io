#My opinion
I really like the concept of static site generators, with a few steps you can build a site and easily change the HTML-structure.
Instead of repeating HTML-code in multiple files you build a framwork of the site and lets the generator process posts and pages according to your setup.

##Suitable projects

##Pros
SSGs are suitable for pages that needs high security, since you don't need any CMS, only plain HTML & CSS you won't be exposed to security exploits in CMS-tools.

If you're depending on high security SSGs is a good option, no security issues caused by old CMS-versions!
Text manipulation, easy to perform text processing since saved in plain text

##Cons
Depending on the level of programming knowledge it may take som time to learn how to set up a site with a SSG compared to for example a wordpress installation. You need to know some basics
in the terminal, HTML, CSS. If you plan to build a large site, have in mind it may take som time to update the site.
