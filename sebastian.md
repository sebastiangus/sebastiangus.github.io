# Late adopter
Spent to many hours gaming in the teenage years, now trying to learn everything I missed for the passed 15 years.
Employee of Infomaker Scandinavia, mainly responsible for accounting. Hopefully will be able to automate most parts of
my daily admnistrative tasks and instead spend my hours doing something more developing.

This is my first experience building a site with Jekyll, using markdown and sass.
